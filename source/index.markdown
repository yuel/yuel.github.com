I'm a programmer, web developer, art enthusiast, and first-year student at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) studying electrical engineering and computer science.

When I'm on a computer, I'm usually coding, doing graphic design, playing a video game, or browsing reddit and tech news. When I'm not at a screen I enjoy playing classical music on the piano, watching indie/sci-fi movies and dancing.
