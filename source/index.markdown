Hello, my name is Mark. I'd call myself very junior programmer, web developer, art enthusiast, and recently started my career at [IBM GDC](http://www.google.com.hk/#newwindow=1&q=IBM+GDC&safe=strict) working on a B2C project.

When I'm on a computer, I'm usually coding, playing video games, or browsing tech news. When I'm not at a screen I enjoy pop music, every kind of movies and shooting photos around.

If you'd like to chat, feel free to email me at <lonnglau@gmail.com>.
