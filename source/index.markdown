I'm a programmer, web developer, art enthusiast, and recently started my career at [IBM GDC](http://www.google.com.hk/#newwindow=1&q=IBM+GDC&safe=strict) working on a B2C project.

When I'm on a computer, I'm usually coding, playing a video game, or browsing tech news. When I'm not at a screen I enjoy listening to Billboard, watching movies.
